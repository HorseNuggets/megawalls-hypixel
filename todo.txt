^ this is to allow for the assign method to have one default thing without having to rewrite the same code

option to add more bullet points in display thing

**USE linkedlist for the classes, so they don't appear in a random order when displayed


method for dealing true damage, then things like golem can counteract that and such


***EVENTUALLY make class passives a lot more deliberate, and have an action bar display to show exactly the time remaining for each

maybe in the future make a simple way to add cooldowns

duplicate code for explosion cancelling in skeleton and creeper, eventually make a handler for both of them

don't forget to make enderman drop diamond related things on death

OPTIMIZE respawn thing, instead of going all the way up to 255, just add up and down depending on if the location is solid or not
  ^ glitch when there is snow, doesn't spawn you entirely, to fix spawn 1 extra block up


add time limit to dreadlord for how long the heads can last


make it so when you select a class, it will store a list of non-mw items that will be given to you again after you select the class

MAKE THE YML STORAGE not per hit, but overall when plugin is onDisable()
