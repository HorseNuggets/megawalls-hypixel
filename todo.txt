maybe make MWClass a normal class, not an interface, with other classes being extends instead of implements
^ this is to allow for the assign method to have one default thing without having to rewrite the same code

option to add more bullet points in display thing

**USE linkedlist for the classes, so they don't appear in a random order when displayed

cannot drop or pick up mega walls items, cannot even drop them on death

exception for those in creative mode

method for dealing true damage, then things like golem can counteract that and such

health display!!!
